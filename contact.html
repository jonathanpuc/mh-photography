		<div class="about-text">I am a photographer that works over a wide variety of subjects, ranging all the way from the news, to sport all the way to parties and events. I have always had a strong passion for photography, and I have always worked as hard as possible to get further and further within the field of my passion. The way that photography allows for creativeness with no limits has always captivated me, it is what strives to make me a better photographer and it is what allows me to constantly be on the hunt to learn more. I’ve recently started working at a newspaper where I cover a wide range of events. I am also constantly working on personal projects, as well as projects for clients. I love the challenge that photography brings, and having worked with a range of clients, nothing is more rewarding to myself, than delivering high quality images. If you are interested in booking me for an event, match, race etc. Then please don’t hesitate to get in touch!</div>
